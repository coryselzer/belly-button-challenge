# **Belly-Button Challenge**

## Project Overview
This is the belly-button challenge. This challenge aims to build an interactive dashboard that explores microbial data.

## Project Goals

- We pull in the data from the JSON url.
- We create functions to display the metadata, OTU IDs, sample values and OTU labels on both a variable side profile as well as two plots.
- We also format the plots to display the plots in a visually appealing manner with proper labelling techniques.
- Finally, we deploy the app to Github Pages.
